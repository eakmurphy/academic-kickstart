abstract = "While there are many long-term air temperature data from numerous weather stations in the United States, similar records for water temperature are rare. Such a record, however, exists for the Hudson River based on direct measruements of river temperature made daily at the Poughkeepsie Water Treatment Facility (PWTF). This record goes back to 1908 and provides an opporutnity to analyze tempeature change and to benchmark river tempeatures relative to future climate that will likely be much warmer."
