# Biography

I study aquatic biomechanics: how organisms interact with their fluid environment. I am a postdoc in the Department of Zoology at Stockholm University, where I am working on the hydrodynamics of fish schooling. I use my background in both organismal biology and fluid physics to study how organisms respond to environmental change, influence ecosystem processes, and impact engineered systems. Previous work utilized field surveys and laboratory experiments to study the biomechanics of coastal burrowing organisms, including burrowing kinematics and fluid and mass transport within burrows. I also conducted laboratory studies of the effects of biofilms on boundary layer flow dynamics, because biofilm fouling significantly impacts ship performance due to a large drag penalty. Previously, I was a postdoc at Ume√• University, in northern Sweden, where I studied interactions between burrowing organisms and biofilm on sediment-water transport processes.
